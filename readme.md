Coding Challenge

The object of this coding challenge was to parse an XML document containing the Shakespeare play, The Tragedy of Julius Caesar.

- The root path is a list of all plays
- Clicking on a play will navigate you to a table showing you a number of statistics for each role
  - Each record has the name of a role, the number of lines spoken, longest speech (based on number of lines in the speech), number of scenes the role appears in and the percentage of scenes the role appears in.
  - Each column is sortable, ascending and descending if the column header is clicked.
    - The sort is done with ajax and jQuery so that the entire page is not loaded each sort.
